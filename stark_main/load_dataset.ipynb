Threaded the fly and tied a cinch knot with no issues several times. It does a lot more, but this alone made it worth it. Ever tried tying on a fly with cold fingers or low light? The only downside is I wish there was a color difference in the v slot where the line threads in. Not a big enough deal to make a difference in opinion.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "But this nice little gadget lets me tie even #22 flies onto a leader with ease. (And I couldn't really tie those on even when I was 25!) Using this tool to thread the tiniest hook eyes onto a leader may sometimes take a little concentration (must use a leader size appropriate for the hook eye, after all), but threading isn't the main thing we need--invariably our problem is tying the knot itself, without crushing the hackle, burying the hook into our finger, or losing the fly in the river during the attempt to hand-tie the knot. With this tool, in 8 or 10 seconds a secure clinch knot is done. Zero chance of losing the fly, having to start over, or foul language. I now find it easy to make the decision whether to try a different fly, because changing flies costs me almost no fishing time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tool ties securely to a cord on the vest and is just plain there when (constantly) needed. The knots are as clean & compact and good as a knot can be. One time I did not have this tool with me, and I lost 20 minutes of my last fishing hour changing flies a couple of times.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as I can get the fly threaded (this thing does often help with that too, although no tool is perfect for the very smallest of hook eyes on a bushy fly), then with this tool the job of tying the knot is a done deal.\n",

There are some limitations to what it can help to accomplish.  For example, you cannot thread a line of large diameter through the eye of a smaller fly.  The 6X tippet or smaller diameters (7X, 8X, etc.) are required for the smaller flies.  Larger diameter tippets greater than 6X (5X, 4X, 3X, etc.) can be threaded into medium and large flies.  I was skeptical at first (and sometimes still don't accomplish all tasks that I would like to) but it has been tremendously helpful with knot tying as well.  Tying tippet-knots that create leader at the end of fly line is much simpler and quicker, and so is the knot thats needed once the line is threaded through the eye of the hook/fly.  The magnet that holds the fly is relatively strong to secure the fly while threading the eye.  Those who struggle with focusing (poor vision) will especially find it helpful.

      "- details:\n",
      "  - description: Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasite medication. It was first marketed under the name Stromectol® and used against worms (except tapeworms), but, in 2012, it was approved for the topical treatment of head lice infestations in patients 6 months of age and older, and marketed under the name Sklice™ as well. Ivermectin is mainly used in humans in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but is also effective against other worm infestations (such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis and enterobiasis).\n",
      "  - half_life: 16 hours (also reported at 22-28 hours)\n",
      "  - indication: For the treatment of intestinal (i.e., nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i>. Also for the treatment of onchocerciasis (river blindness) due to the nematode parasite <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i>. Can be used to treat scabies caused by <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i>.\n",
      "  - mechanism_of_action: Ivermectin binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in invertebrate muscle and nerve cells of the microfilaria. This binding causes an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions and results in hyperpolarization of the cell, leading to paralysis and death of the parasite. Ivermectin also is believed to act as an agonist of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby disrupting GABA-mediated central nervous system (CNS) neurosynaptic transmission. Ivermectin may also impair normal intrauterine development of O. volvulus microfilariae and may inhibit their release from the uteri of gravid female worms.\n",
      "  - protein_binding: 93%\n",
      "  - pharmacodynamics: Ivermectin is a semisynthetic, anthelminitic agent. It is an avermectin which a group of pentacyclic sixteen-membered lactone (i.e. a macrocyclic lactone disaccharide) derived from the soil bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. Avermectins are potent anti-parasitic agents. Ivermectin is the most common avermectin. It is a broad spectrum antiparasitic drug for oral administration. It is sometimes used to treat human onchocerciasis (river blindness). It is the mixture of 22,23-dihydro-avermectin B1a (at least 90%) and 22,23-dihydro-avermectin B1b (less than 10%).\n",
      "  - state: Ivermectin is a solid.\n",
      "  - atc_1: Ivermectin is anatomically related to antiparasitic products, insecticides and repellents and dermatologicals.\n",
      "  - atc_2: Ivermectin is in the therapeutic group of anthelmintics and other dermatological preparations.\n",
      "  - atc_3: Ivermectin is pharmacologically related to antinematodal agents and other dermatological preparations.\n",
      "  - atc_4: The chemical and functional group of  is avermectines and other dermatologicals.\n",
      "  - category: Ivermectin is part of Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity ; Agrochemicals ; Anthelmintics ; Anti-Bacterial Agents ; Anti-Infective Agents ; Antinematodal Agents ; Antiparasitic Agents ; Antiparasitic Products, Insecticides and Repellents ; Avermectines ; BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates ; Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting ; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers ; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors ; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates ; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers ; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown) ; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates ; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers ; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors ; Cytochrome P-450 Substrates ; Dermatologicals ; Insecticides ; Lactones ; OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors ; OATP1B3 inhibitors ; P-glycoprotein inducers ; P-glycoprotein inhibitors ; P-glycoprotein substrates ; Pediculicides ; Pesticides ; Polyketides ; Scabicides and Pediculicides ; Toxic Actions.\n",
